 * Utility exception that can be used as an alternative to returning AssertionStatus.FAILED from a server assertion.

 * Failure conditions that may occur frequently, like a failed ComparisonAssertion, should not be reported with
 * this mechanism since it is much less expensive to just return AssertionStatus.FAILED instead.
