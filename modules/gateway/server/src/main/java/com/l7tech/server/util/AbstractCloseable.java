/**
 * Utility superclass that maintains a closed flag and ensures that only the first call to close() will result
 * in a dispatch to doClose().
 * <p/>
 * This class does not formally implement {@link java.io.Closeable} because not all subclasses
 * necessarily want to make their close() method public.
 * <p/>
 * This superclass does not provide a finalize method.  The presence of a finalize method, especially on an
 * object whose lifecycle is within a single request, can cause objects to pile up on the finalizer queue
 * (to the point of filling up memory and crashing, in some circumstances -- see Bug #2953).  Implementors
 * can of course provide their own finalize method if it is really, truly, absolutely necessary (to free
 * hardware resources, for example).
 * <p/>
 * Note that you do NOT need a finalize method just because you keep a reference to an object that has its own.
