#Usage options text
usage.desc = <b>Outbound SSL Connections</b>: Using HTTPS or LDAPS, the Gateway can \
             connect to protected Web services or LDAPS directories hosted on SSL servers that use \
             this certificate.  This option should be selected if the server certificate is self-signed. \
             <p><b>Signing Certificates for Outbound SSL Connections</b>: Using HTTPS or LDAPS, the \
             Gateway can connect to protected Web services or LDAPS directories hosted \
             on SSL servers whose certificates were signed by this certificate authority. If \
             several SSL server certificates are signed using an in-house certificate authority, \
             then the Gateway can connect to all of them if this option is used.</p> \
             <p><b>Signing Client Certificates</b>: A Federated Identity Provider can be configured \
             to authorize identities whose X.509 certificates were signed by this certificate \
             authority certificate.</p> \
             <p><b>Signing SAML Tokens</b>: A Federated Identity Provider can be configured to \
             authorize identities whose SAML Tokens were signed by this certificate.</p> \
             <p><b>SAML Attesting Entity</b>: A Federated Identity Provider can be configured to \
             authorize identities that attest SAML Tokens. Applies to <b>sender-vouches</b> \
             subject confirmation only.</p>
usage.desc.validation = <b>Certificate is a Trust Anchor</b>: When checked, this certificate is \
             used as a Trust Anchor when building certificate paths. If a certificate is not a \
             Trust Anchor, then its issuer should be added as a Trusted Certificate.\
             <p><b>Verify Hostnames for Outbound SSL connections</b>: When using SSL or TLS, \
             the Gateway will verify that the server hostnames match the Name in the \
             certificate.</p> \
             <p><b>Revocation Checking</b>: Select the revocation checking option to use with this \
             certificate.</p>
