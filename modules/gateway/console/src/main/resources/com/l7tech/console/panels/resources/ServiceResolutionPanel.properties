step.label=Service Resolution
step.description=The default option 'No resolution path' sets the service resolution path to '/ssg/soap'. To use another resolution path instead, select 'Custom resolution path' and then specify a custom URI. The resolution path can also be modified under the [HTTP/FTP] tab in the Published Service Properties later.
