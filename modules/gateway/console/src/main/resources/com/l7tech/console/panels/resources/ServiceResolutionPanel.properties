step.label=Service Resolution
step.description=The default "No resolution path" indicates the service does not have a custom resolution path; all requests are sent to the default Gateway URI "/ssg/soap".  Use "Custom resolution path" to send requests to any other URI.  You may change this setting later using the [HTTP/FTP] tab in the Published Service Properties.
