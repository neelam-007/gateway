# Observer type to show in WSDM Manager.
# Add this line to \Program Files\CA\Unicenter WSDM\server\default\conf\WsdmSOMMA_Basic.properties
#     observertype.777=SecureSpan Gateway
# Default: 777

# WSDM Manager endpoint address.
# (REQUIRED) If not specified, the Observer will be disabled.
managerSoapEndpoint=http://hostname:8282/wsdm35mmi/services/WSDM35MMI

# Determines whether the Observer reports all newly discovered WSDLs and
# registers them with the Catalog.
# If set to no, all new WSDL files must be manually imported into the Catalog
# for the services to be registered.
# For a description of this functionality, see Maintaining the Catalog in the
# CA WSDM online help.
# Default: yes
autoDiscover=yes

# Determines whether all requests arriving at the Observer will be allowed
# through, even if the request was not previously identified in the Manager
# Catalog.
# If you change the setting to yes, the Observer will not process unidentified requests.
# Default: no
blockUnknown=no

# If this parameter is set to yes, all SOAP messages passing through the
# observer will be sent to the manager for logging (and SOAP message is included
# in locallog records).
# If set to no, only messages which have violated single transaction threshold
# monitor(s) will be sent to the manager (and SOAP messages are omitted from
# local log records).
logSoap=no

# The maximum number of messages allowed in the queue.
# Change as desired if system resources permit.
# Default: 0
queueSizeMax=0

# The minimum number of messages that must be stored before messages are transmitted.
# Allows for transaction-based buffering of data at the Observer level before it
# is sent to the Manager.
queueSizeMin=1

# If this parameter is set to no, then SOAP messages will not be sent to the manager.
# When set to no, this parameter takes precedence over the logSOAP parameter to
# ensure that no SOAP messages are sent to manager.
# When set to yes, sending of SOAP messages to manager is determined by logSOAP
# parameter.
# Note that setting this to yes will increasing CPU and network load on the SSG.
sendSoap=no

# Maximum number of characters per message body to send to WSDM Manager; if
# sending is enabled. The purpose is to limit excessive network usage.
# Default: 5000
com.l7tech.server.module.ca_wsdm.messageBodyLimit=5000

# Specifies whether the Observer logs messages without Manager availability.
# Change as desired if system resources permit.
# Allows users to shut off sending every transaction to manager unless
# transaction produces a fault or transaction statistics exceeds a single
# transaction monitor threshold.
# If the parameter is set to yes, the observer sends only the service request
# information for the transaction that produced faults and those exceeds a
# single transaction monitor threshold.
# Default: no
standaloneMode=no

# The maximum amount of time in minutes before the Observer will try to resend
# data to the Manager if the connection between the Observer and Manager has
# been broken. Change as desired if system resources permit.
# Default: 5
waitPeriod=5
