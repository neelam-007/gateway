Who need what, when

b MIME bytestream
 - read when document is first produced
 - might be read if original document needs to be reconstructed (rollback)
 - regenerated + reread on streamout if document unmodified

o "Original" document - always read-only
 - in SSB, read as PolicyApplicationContext is constructed (cloned working document)
 - in SSB, used for rollback (after obtaining new policy/credentials/certs/etc)
 - in SSB, used by RequestXpathAssertion (both checkRequest() and undecorateReply())

d "Working" document - read-only
 - used by all other assertions unless otherwise specified, if they aren't mutators
 - used to reconstruct MIME bytestream on streamout, if needed

w "Working" document - read/write
 - used by all other assertions unless otherwise specified, if they might be mutators



General guidelines:
 - keep original MIME bytestream
 - on streamout, send original bytestream if d unmodified
 - otherwise, serialize w out directly

questions:
 - is it possible to avoid creating o?  if o is needed only rarely, it can be reconstructed
by reparsing b
