SSG deployment steps for a clean linux box

Preconditions

Redhat linux is installed including postgresql server

know the root password ....

PREPARING THE SERVER
=========================================
Networking (as root)

Set hostname. /etc/sysconfig/networking sets it permanently

Hostname command with the above name to set it on a running system

Create user gateway, choose a password for this user, remember it

Check /etc/hosts. make sure first line reads 127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain

Set IP addresses, using dhcp or netconfig eth0/eth1

If dns does not resolve, adding a line in /etc/hosts makes configuration cleaner.
        i.p.adddy      hostname hostname.domain.com
        is the standard pattern.

eth0 is assumed to be external address.


user postgres should already exist, its only accessible by "su - postgres", do not set
a password. The account should not be able to be logged into.


Server Software

As user Gateway.

Install the toolkit into /ssg
This includes the tomcat, the jdk, the gateway WAR and the config
The kit build SHOULD have included the above configured hostname and root ca name.
if not, a post install will need to be done.


Database:

As root:

change /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf

Allow network access (required for jdbc access)

look for tcpip_socket = false, set to true

Allos scalability of database:

uncomment and set max_connections to 100

Set tcp to only listen on localhost

look for virtual_host. Uncomment it, set to '127.0.0.1'

Restart psql server

    service postgresql restart

make sure it starts at boot

    chkconfig postgresql on
hibernate_unique_key, identity_provider, internal_group, internal_user, internal_user_group, published_service

as Postgres:

    initdb --pgdata=/var/lib/pgsql/data
	createdb ssg
	psql ssg -f /ssg/etc/db/postgres/ssg.sql
    psql ssg;
	CREATE USER gateway WITH PASSWORD 'same_as_linux_passwd';
	GRANT ALL ON
	    hibernate_unique_key, identity_provider,
	    internal_group, internal_user, internal_user_group, published_service
	TO gateway;
	Edit Auth file /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf
    Add this line:
            host  ssg  gateway  127.0.0.1  255.255.255.255  password

DB is now in place

As root
 cp /ssg/dist/etc/ssgruntimedefs.sh /etc/profile.d

Sets JAVA_HOME TOMCAT_HOME

 echo "su - gateway -c /ssg/tomcat/bin/startup.sh -security" >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local

Starts the gateway on machine boot.

As gateway

 run startssg
