Related bug - SSG-7202 Gateway Truncates Content-Type Space Delimiter on Response

The response content type string is generated by the apache catalina library with the following method:
org.apache.coyote.Response#getContentType
 public String getContentType() {

        String ret = contentType;

        if (ret != null
            && characterEncoding != null
            && charsetSet) {
            ret = ret + ";charset=" + characterEncoding;
        }

        return ret;
  }
It didn't put a space between the semicolon and the charset, this class is defined as Final and seem there is no way to override this method.

To resolve this issue a Connector property "trimContentType" (value true/false) is created to configure the space trimming behaviour.

By default trimContentType property is true.
