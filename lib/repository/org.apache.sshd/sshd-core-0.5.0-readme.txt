	Virtual File System improvement for SCP and session injection
	https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-96
		"The SCP Command does not yet use the Virtual File System implemented in SSHD-82.		
		Another improvement is passing the ServerSession to FileSystemFactory instead of just the user name.		
		This allows the injection of information known in the Authenticator into the file system.		
		The particular use case is the implementation of a Virtual File System based on Apache Commons VFS.
		There the authenticator already contains the root file object (resulting from the authentication) which needs to be passed to the FileSystemView."
		
	Use Maven to build and package: mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
