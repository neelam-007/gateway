/**
 * Interface for classes that retrieve {@link com.l7tech.common.security.token.XmlSecurityToken}s.
 * <p>
 * This class uses the term "immediately available" to denote whether a {@link com.l7tech.common.security.token.XmlSecurityToken}
 * is present or easy to acquire:
 * <p>
 * Tokens should be considered to be Immediately Available if they are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Cached in memory
 * <li>On disk, either unencrypted or with the required passphrase already known
 * <li>In a local database, even if the database can only be accessed across a network
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * A token should <em>not</em> be considered to be immediately available if it might take an unpredictably long time
 * to acquire one, or if the acquisition might not succeed. For example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The token is present but encrypted; would need to prompt user for passphrase
 * <li>The token can only be acquired after communication with an external service
 * </ul>
