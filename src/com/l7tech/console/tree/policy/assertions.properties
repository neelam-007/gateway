#//---------Assertion descriptions -----------------\\
# The file contains Assertion descriptions (short, long)
# in the java.util.MessageFormat fgormat.
# The keys are constructed from the assertion class, and
# the 'short'/'long' suffix are appended to it.

# note:
# if you modify any of the message parameters ( {0}, {1} etc..) 
# make sure the apropriate code changes are applied too 
# If you wish to modify the message text  but not the parameters, 
# including parameter position you may  do so here.
