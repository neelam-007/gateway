#Usage options text
usage.desc = <b>Outbound SSL Connections</b>: Using HTTPS or LDAPS, the SecureSpan Gateway can \

             this certificate.  This option should be selected if the server certificate is self-signed. \
             <p><b>Signing Certificates for Outbound SSL Connections</b>: Using HTTPS or LDAPS, the \
             SecureSpan Gateway can connect to protected Web services or LDAPS directories hosted \
             on SSL servers whose certificates were signed by this certificate authority. If \
             several SSL server certificates are signed using an in-house certificate authority, \
             then the SecureSpan Gateway can connect to all of them if this option is used.</p> \
             <p><b>Signing Client Certificates</b>: A Federated Identity Provider can be configured \
             to authorize identities whose X.509 certificates were signed by this certificate \

             <p><b>Verify Hostnames for Outbound SSL connections</b>: When using HTTPS or LDAPS, \
             the SecureSpan Gateway will verify that the server hostnames match the Name in the \
             certificate.</p> \
