<h1>SecureSpan™ Solution Overview</h1>

<p>The SecureSpan™ Solution enables the simple creation and management 
 of Web service security policies. Three architectural components combine 
 to form a powerful standards-based security solution: the SecureSpan™ 
 Gateway, the SecureSpan™ Manager, and the SecureSpan™ Agent.</p>

<p>The SecureSpan™ Gateway is an industry-standard, 1U rack-mount appliance 
 that installs quickly onto any network. The Gateway mediates Web service 
 activities by acting as an engine to create, publish, and enforce policy. 
 The Gateway shields access to internal services, ensuring that only those 
 messages that pass all of its security requirements are ultimately forwarded 
 to the protected Web service. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The SecureSpan™ Manager functions as a single point of policy management 
 for the Gateway, which can exist as a single Gateway or a cluster of parallel 
 systems within an organization. The Manager is used to create and manage 
 Web service security policies, configure the Gateway, manage policy users, 
 and monitor Gateway status and performance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The SecureSpan™ Agent simplifies the task of layering security onto 
 Web service transactions. The Agent follows the policy directives of the 
 Gateway. Policy changes are instantly loaded and applied on the Agent 
 without changing any code. The Agent also manages client-side certificates 
 issued by the Gateway, thereby ensuring strong authentication, digital 
 signing, and message-based encryption. </p>

<h3>SecureSpan<symbol name=Trademark>&#8482; 
 Gateway</h3>

<p>Typically residing between the application server and the DMZ, the SecureSpan™ 
 Gateway is a rack-mountable, high-performance network appliance that enforces 
 all provider-side security and integration policies. No manual configuration 
 or integration of Web services is required.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Gateway is an intelligent message-processing engine that controls 
 Web services security policies provisioned through the SecureSpan™ Manager. 
 The Gateway identifies and processes each request and response message 
 in accordance with the Web service security policy. It shields access 
 to internal services, ensuring that only messages that meet all security 
 and integration requirements are forwarded. Although delivered as a network 
 appliance, the Gateway tightly integrates with existing network infrastructure 
 including identity and network management systems. The Gateway is normally 
 deployed in a high-availability, active-standby configuration. The appliance 
 can easily peer with other Gateways to form scalable clusters for high 
 volume processing. For more information on monitoring the Gateway from 
 the Manager, see <a href="SecureSpan_Gateway_Analysis_Overview.htm">SecureSpan™ 
 Gateway Analysis Overview</a>.</p>

<p>The SecureSpan™ Manager is a GUI-based application that enables users 
 to centrally define, provision, and monitor security and integration policies 
 for Web services. The Manager offers two user interfaces: 1) a GUI for 
 defining Web services and security policies (see <a href="SecureSpan_Manager_Interface.htm">SecureSpan<symbol 
 name=Trademark>&#8482; Manager Interface</a>) 
 and 2) a Troubleshooting Mode for assessing issues with the SecureSpan™ 
 Gateway (see <a HREF="SecureSpan_Manager_Troubleshooting_Mode.htm">SecureSpan™ 
 Manager Troubleshooting Mode</a>). Through the Manager, users connect 
 to shared Web services and establish trust and identity sources with existing 
 infrastructure. Personalized security policies are defined through policy 
 assertions that include transport protocols, message signing and encryption, 
 credential validation, and message routing declarations. Policy changes, 
 additions, or deletions are implemented in real-time by the Gateway and 
 applied to all subsequent messages. For more information about the Manager, 
 see <a href="SecureSpan_Manager_Overview.htm">SecureSpan™ Manager Overview</a>.</p>

<h3>SecureSpan<symbol name=Trademark>&#8482; 
 Agent </h3>

<p>The SecureSpan™ Agent interfaces with client-side applications and automatically 
 negotiates policy-specific security, routing, and transaction preferences 
 with the SecureSpan™ Gateway. The Agent resides on the same hardware platform 
 as the Web services client and establishes a PKI-based trust relationship 
 with multiple Gateways. Client systems send SOAP requests to the Agent. 
 The Agent then negotiates the appropriate policy with the Gateway and 
 applies any necessary protocols, headers, or transformations. Changes 
 made to existing security policies in the SecureSpan™ Manager are propagated 
 by the Gateway to the appropriate Agents. These Agents then apply the 
 changes to ensure that subsequent messages conform to the updated policy. 
 The Agent transparently off-loads the complexity of security policy, key, 
 and certificate management without adding coding to the client application. 
 This enforces the consistent application of policy while ensuring a robust 
 and flexible Web services implementation. For more information on the 
 Agent, see <a href="SecureSpan_Agent_Overview.htm">SecureSpan™ Agent Overview</a>.</p>

<p>The SecureSpan™ Gateway consists of a high performance server that executes 
 core messaging, security, and management software. The appliance provides 
 a high availability solution and supports an active standby configuration 
 with database synchronization capabilities. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Web services are centrally managed and audited through the SecureSpan™ 
 Manager. The Manager resides outside of the DMZ, allowing users to de-couple 
 policy control from a Web service’s programmed business logic so that 
 no manual configuration of the Web service itself is required. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The client-side SecureSpan™ Agent streamlines the process of coordinating 
 security between Web services and their clients. Residing non-invasively 
 on any Linux, Solaris, or .NET application platform, the Agent automates 
 the negotiation of both transport and message-level security. Web service 
 security policies that are defined through the Gateway are retrieved by 
 the Agent. Messages from the Agent are then automatically formatted with 
 all of the security parameters required to be trusted and processed by 
 the Gateway. </p>
