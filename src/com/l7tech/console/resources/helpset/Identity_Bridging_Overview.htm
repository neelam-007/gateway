<h2>The Identity Silo Problem</h2>

<p>Controlling access to applications exposed as Web services requires 
 the authentication and authorization of requesting identities. Authentication 
 involves the presentation and validation of credentials, and authorization 
 involves granting access, rights, or entitlements based on the interpretation 
 of the authentication results. For consistent management, identities are 
 typically stored in the same security domain as the application. During 
 the authentication and authorization process, the exact elements in an 
 identity are matched to the functional requirements of the services served 
 by the identity provider. Identities from one identity provider rarely 
 have the same or any relevance outside of their local security domain, 
 indirectly leading to an “identity silo.” Identity silos are a serious 
 problem for enterprises wanting to integrate applications residing in 
 different security domains.</p>

<h6>&nbsp;</h6>

<p>If a legitimate requestor authenticates against a corresponding identity 
 provider in one identity silo, its identity or any evidence of the authentication 
 may have no relevance when requesting access to another Web service in 
 another identity silo inside or outside the enterprise. Disparate identity 
 providers within an enterprise or between partners complicates the authentication 
 and authorization process, resulting in broken integrations and failed 
 authorizations in one silo even when authentication succeeded in another 
 silo. </p>

<h2>Identity Bridging for Cross-Domain Application Integration</h2>

<p>Identity bridging is a powerful mechanism for merging identities from 
 disparate security domains. Essentially, identity bridging splits up the 
 authentication and authorization tasks that occur between security domains, 
 delegating authentication to the requestor domain while preserving authorization 
 for the provider domain hosting the Web service. In a mergers and acquisitions 
 scenario, for example, Enterprise A merges with Enterprise B. Each enterprise 
 has its own identity provider, but would like to share identities with 
 minimum resources and no interruption to their existing security architectures. 
 Using the SecureSpan™ Solution, identity bridging is configured between 
 Enterprise A and Enterprise B using one of two credential source types: 
 a SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) Security assertion (see <a href="Identity_Bridging_Workflow.htm">Identity Bridging Workflow Using 
 SAML</a>) or an X.509 certificate (see <a href="Identity_Bridging_Workflow_Using_an_X.509_Certificate.htm">Identity 
 Bridging Workflow Using an X.509 Certificate</a>).</p>

 For brevity, the generic &quot;Trusted Gateway A&quot; and &quot;Federated 
 Gateway B&quot; references are used in all identity bridging examples, 
 workflows, and instructions. The Trusted Gateway A is the certificate 
 authority (CA) that issues and manages security credentials and that is 
 responsible for authentication. The Federated Gateway B is the Web service 
 provider that is responsible for authorization. The words &quot;trusted&quot; 
 and &quot;federated&quot; are used from the point of view of the service 
 requestor.</p>

<h2>Identity Bridging with the SecureSpan™ Solution</h2>

<p>All three SecureSpan™ Solution products work in tandem to enable identity 
 bridging:</p>

<h3>SecureSpan™ Gateway</h3>

<p>The required provider-side SecureSpan™ Gateway, known as the &quot;Federated 
 Gateway B,&quot; is used for authorization in an identity bridging configuration. 
 The Federated Gateway B establishes a certificate-based trust relationship 
 with the authentication source by importing trusted certificates into 
 its trust store. The authentication source can be any certificate authority 
 (CA) or another Gateway that acts as a CA. </p>

<h6>&nbsp;</h6>

			margin-right: 4px;

			float: none;

<p class="tipsnotes"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B><img src="NOTEfinal.gif" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" style="border: none;

	height: 15px;
	float: none;
	border-style: none;
	border-style: none;" width="16" height="15" border="0"> &nbsp;NOTE:</B></span> 
 When SAML is used as a credential source in an identity bridging configuration, 
 the authentication source must be able to issue a SAML token. If another 
 SecureSpan™ Gateway is used as the credential source, then it is already 
 able to issue a SAML token. See <a href="Identity_Bridging_Workflow.htm">Identity 
 Bridging Workflow Using SAML</a> for more information.</p>
</div>

<h6>&nbsp;</h6>

<p>The Federated Gateway B uses three types of federated identities for 
 mediating requestor credentials: federated users, federated groups, and 
 virtual groups (see <a HREF="FIP_Overview.htm">Federated Identity Provider 
 Overview</a>). It delegates authentication to one or more Trusted Gateway 
 A(s) while preserving authorization for the Federated Gateway B.</p>

<h3>SecureSpan™ Bridge</h3>

<p>The requestor-side SecureSpan™ Bridge is responsible for decorating 
 request messages based on the Web service security policy assertions defined 
 in the Federated Gateway B. Decorated messages are sent from the Bridge 
 to the Federated Gateway B for Web service authorization. If a security 
 policy contains a SAML Security assertion, then part of the Bridge’s decorating 
 task may involve getting a SAML token from the Trusted Gateway A during 
 the initial connection or if the original SAML token has expired.</p>

<h3>SecureSpan™ Manager</h3>

<p>The SecureSpan™ Manager provides the interface for importing trusted 
 certificates (CA certificates and/or server certificates extracted from 
 the Trusted Gateway A) into the Federated Gateway B trust store. The Manager 
 also provides the interface to configure and manage one or more Federated 
 Identity Providers (FIPs), link trust store certificate(s) to FIPs, and 
 configure the Federated Gateway B SAML security policy.</p>
