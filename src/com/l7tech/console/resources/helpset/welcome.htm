<h1>Secure Span<symbol name=Trademark>&#8482; 
 Manager Help</h1>

<p>The SecureSpan<symbol name=Trademark>&#8482; 
 Manager online help provides detailed information about the Manager functionality 
 and purpose. This help can be accessed via the Help menu or by accessing 
 the context-sensitive help content via the F1 key. The online help includes 
 contact information, a user interface overview, setup instructions, and 
 detailed instructions for creating security policies and for troubleshooting 
 issues.</p>

<h2>SecureSpan<symbol name=Trademark>&#8482; 
 Manager</h2>

<p>The Manager functions as the interface to the SecureSpan<symbol name=Trademark>&#8482; 
 Gateway. The Manager offers two user interfaces, a GUI for managing Web 
 service security and a command-line interface for troubleshooting issues 
 with the Gateway. Administrators also use this application to configure 
 the Gateway, manage policy users, and to monitor the Gateway appliance 
 status.</p>

<h3>Technical Functionality</h3>

<p>The Manager is a Java-based application that provides a single, unified 
 view into the Gateway. Located on the internal LAN, the Manager communicates 
 with the Gateway over default ports. Administrators use the Manager’s 
 toolset to build a set of users, groups, and policies. Policies are constructed 
 with pre-set assertions to establish authentication, transport security, 
 and message routing. The toolset offered in the Manager is based on WS-Security 
 standards.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>The Gateway is pre-configured with a single administrative identity. 
 More administrators can be added as needed. Once the Manager is installed, 
 the administrator configures the Manager properties to communicate with 
 the Gateway through port 8443. The administrator then creates user identities, 
 groups, and publishes Web services with their associated policies. These 
 policies can be enabled or disabled as required.</p>
