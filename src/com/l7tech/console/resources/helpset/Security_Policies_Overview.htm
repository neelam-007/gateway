 Become familiar with the policy and assertion information and rules in 
 <a href="Security_Policy_Organization_and_Rules.htm">Security Policy Organization 
 and Rules</a> before configuring a security policy. </p>
</div>

<p>The core function of the SecureSpan™ Manager is its ability to centrally 
 define, provision, monitor, and audit security and integration policies 
 for Web services and XML applications, collectively referred to as &quot;services.&quot; 
 </p>

<h6>&nbsp;</h6>

<p>After a service is published using the Publish Web Service Wizard (see 
 <a href="Manage_SOAP_Web_Services.htm">Manage SOAP Web Services</a>), 
 Create WSDL Wizard (see <a href="Manage_SOAP_Web_Services.htm">Manage 
 SOAP Web Services</a>), or Publish XML Application Wizard (see <a HREF="Manage_XML_Applications.htm">Manage 
 XML Applications</a>), the service appears in the [Services] tab and an 
 initial policy is created in the Policy Development window. If a published 
 Web service WSDL document contained at least one HTTP(S) binding, then 
 the initial policy will include an HTTP(S) Routing assertion pre-configured 
 to point to the HTTP(S) binding URL. Before a service is adequately protected, 
 additional security policy assertions may need to be defined and configured 
 into a security policy that is saved in the SecureSpan™ Gateway. </p>

 If an authentication method and authorization to specific users and/or 
 groups was defined during the Web service or XML application publication 
 process, then service access will be restricted to those identities in 
 the initial security policy. The initial security policy will automatically 
 be populated with an authentication assertion for each Grant Access to 
 Users/Groups assertion corresponding to each selected identity. See <a href="Configure_Edit_Authentication_Assertions.htm">Configure and Edit 
 Authentication Assertions</a> for more information.</p>
</div>

<p>A security policy defines restrictions for the consumption of a published 
 Gateway-protected service. For more information on security policies and 
 assertions, see <a href="Security_Policy_Organization_and_Rules.htm">Security 
 Policy Organization and Rules</a>. For information on the interface areas 
 related to services and security policies, see <a href="SecureSpan_Manager_Interfaces.htm">SecureSpan<symbol 
 name=Trademark>&#8482; Manager Interfaces</a>. 
 For information on using and configuring the security policy assertions 
 in the [Assertions] tab, see <a href="Security_Policy_Assertions_Overview.htm">Security 
 Policy Assertions Overview</a>. For information on configuring a security 
 policy in the Policy Development window, see <a href="Configure_Edit_Security_Policies.htm">Configure 
 and Edit Security Policies</a>.</p>
