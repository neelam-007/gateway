<h1>Agent User Interface</h1>

<p>The Agent interface is designed for simple administrative tasks. This 
 supports the Agent's key purpose of running discreetly in the background 
 unless the administrator needs to configure the settings or troubleshoot 
 an issue. </p>

<h2>User Interface Modes</h2>

<p>The Agent includes two main UI modes: GUI and Troubleshooting. The GUI 
 mode is used to create, configure, and delete Gateway connections. The 
 Troubleshooting mode is used to evaluate connectivity issues and messages. 
 The Agent can be launched in either mode via Start&gt; All Programs&gt; 
 SecureSpan Agent. </p>

<h3>GUI Mode</h3>

<p>GUI mode provides easy access to the Agent properties. This mode is 
 used to change the Gateway settings, set the authentication credentials, 
 and view messages. The key configuration functionality can be accessed 
 via the three buttons. More complex functionality is accessed with the 
 three menu options. </p>

<h4>Menus</h4>

<p>The GUI mode offers three simple menus: File, Window, and Help. The 
 File menu mirrors the key functionality available in the buttons – New, 
 Properties, Set Default, and Delete – as well as the Quit function. The 
 Window menu provides functionality to view messages in a separate window. 
 The Help menu provides version information about the SecureSpan Agent 
 application.</p>

<h4>Buttons</h4>

<p>The buttons reflect the key Agent functions that relate to the Gateway(s): 
 New, Properties, Set Default, and Delete. Both the New and the Properties 
 buttons launch the Gateway Properties dialog box. The Set Default button 
 sets the Gateway highlighted in the Agent main window as the default Gateway. 
 The Delete button deletes the connection information for the Gateway selected 
 in the Agent main window.</p>

<h4>Properties</h4>

<p>The Properties dialog box contains the key functionality for configuring 
 the Agent. The dialog box displays four tabs: General, Identity, Network, 
 and Policies. The General tab is used to configure the URL associated 
 with each Gateway. The Identity tab displays the authentication and certificate 
 information for the Gateway. The Network tab relays the proxy and port 
 information associated with that Gateway. The Policies tab is used to 
 evaluate and troubleshoot any problems with a Gateway’s policies. </p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Mode</h3>

<p>Troubleshooting mode launches the Agent GUI with an MS DOS prompt. The 
 DOS prompt displays a detailed narration about the messages communicated 
 to the Agent. This mode is used by the Agent administrator and Layer 7 
 support staff to evaluate connectivity issues. </p>
