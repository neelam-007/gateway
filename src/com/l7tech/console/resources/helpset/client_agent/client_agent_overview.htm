<h1>Client Agent Overview</h1>

<p>The Client Agent exists to simplify the task of layering security onto 
 Web services transactions. The Client Agent follows the policy directives 
 of the Gateway. The administrator’s policy changes are instantly loaded 
 and applied on the Client Agent without changing a line of code in the 
 application. The Client Agent also manages client-side certificates issued 
 by the Gateway, providing the benefits of strong authentication, digital 
 signing, and message-based encryption. </p>

<p>The Client Agent loads policies from the Gateway the first time a service 
 is called. For every SOAP message the Proxy receives, it decorates the 
 message according to the rules defined in the policy. For example, the 
 policy may demand that the message body be encrypted with AES encryption 
 under the WS-Security standard, and that the entire message body be signed 
 by the client’s private key. The Proxy will interpret this policy and 
 modify the transaction accordingly before sending it downstream to the 
 Gateway. </p>
