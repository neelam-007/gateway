<h1>Product Overview</h1>

<p>This SecureSpan<symbol name=Trademark>&#8482; 
 Solution consists of three major components:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>The SecureSpan Manager</B></span> - enables 
 administrators to centrally define, provision, and manage security and 
 integration policies. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>The SecureSpan Gateway</B></span> – a network 
 appliance that interfaces to the Web services application server and enforces 
 all provider-side security and integration policies.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>The SecureSpan Agent</B></span> - interfaces 
 to the client-side application and automatically negotiates policy-specific 
 security, routing and transaction preferences with the SecureSpan Gateway.</p>

<h2>SecureSpan<symbol name=Trademark>&#8482; 
 Manager</h2>

<p>The SecureSpan Manager is a GUI-based application that enables administrators 
 to centrally define, provision, and monitor security and integration policies 
 for Web services. </p>

<p>Through the Manager, administrators connect to shared Web services, 
 establish trust and identity sources with existing infrastructure. They 
 use these sources to define personalized policies through a declarative, 
 rich policy language of assertions, and provision policies to existing 
 clients.</p>

<p>Administrators can fine-tune policies by choosing from a rich palette 
 of assertions including transport protocols, key management, message signing 
 and encryption, credential validation and message routing. Policy changes, 
 additions, or deletions are implemented in real-time by the SecureSpan 
 Gateway and applied to all subsequent messages.</p>

<h2>SecureSpan<symbol name=Trademark>&#8482; 
 Gateway</h2>

<p>Typically residing between the application server and the DMZ, the SecureSpan 
 Gateway is a rack-mountable, high-performance network appliance that enforces 
 all provider-side security and integration policies. No manual configuration 
 or integration of Web services is required.</p>

<p>The Gateway is an intelligent message-processing engine that controls 
 Web services policy provisioned through the SecureSpan Manager. The Gateway 
 identifies and processes each message under the policy created for the 
 service. It shields access to internal services, ensuring that only messages 
 that meet all security and integration policy requirements are forwarded.</p>

<p>Although delivered as a network appliance, the Gateway tightly integrates 
 with existing network infrastructure including identity and network management 
 systems. The SecureSpan Gateway is normally deployed in a high-availability, 
 active-standby configuration. The appliance can easily be peered with 
 other Gateways to form scalable SecureSpan clusters for high volume processing.</p>

<h2>SecureSpan<symbol name=Trademark>&#8482; 
 Agent </h2>

<p>The SecureSpan Agent interfaces with client-side applications and automatically 
 negotiates policy-specific security, routing, and transaction preferences 
 with the SecureSpan Gateway.</p>

<p>The SecureSpan Agent resides on the same hardware platform as the Web 
 services client and establishes a PKI-based trust relationship with multiple 
 SecureSpan Gateways. Client systems send SOAP requests to the Agent. The 
 Agent then negotiates the appropriate policy with the Gateway and applies 
 any necessary protocols, headers, or transformations. Changes made to 
 existing policies in the SecureSpan Manager are propagated by the Gateway 
 to the appropriate Agents. These Agents then apply the changes to ensure 
 that subsequent messages conform to the updated policy</p>

<p>The SecureSpan Agent transparently offloads the complexity of managing 
 policies, keys, and certificates without adding coding to the client application. 
 This enforces the consistent application of policy while ensuring a robust, 
 flexible Web services implementation.</p>
