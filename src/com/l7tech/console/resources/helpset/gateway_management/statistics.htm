<h1>Statistics</h1>

<p>The Statistics tab offers basic statistics on the Web Service activity 
 that is monitored by the Manager. Administrators can use this data to 
 track the Gateway performance and troubleshoot potential issues with individual 
 services.</p>

<p>The statistics are organized by service name and these names are listed 
 in alphabetical order. The statistics include attempted requests, authorized 
 requests, completed requests, and the rate of completed requests. If the 
 auto-refresh check box is selected, the statistics are continually updated 
 as the data changes. </p>

<p class="note"><span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Note:</I></span> The HTTP Digest 
 authentication method counts two requests for each &quot;attempted request.&quot; 
 The first message represents a challenge request before the actual client 
 request message. Other authentication methods count only one message per 
 request.</p>

<p class="procedure">To view the Gateway statistics:</p>

<ol style="list-style: decimal;"
	type=1>
	
	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Select <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>View</B></span> 
 &gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Statistics</B></span>. The Statistics 
 tab appears at the bottom of the user interface.</p></li>
	
	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Select <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Auto-refresh</B></span> 
 to receive the most recent statistics data. </p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Server Uptime and Average Load</h2>

<p>The statistics tab also offers basic information about the server uptime 
 and the average load per minute. The server uptime is counted from the 
 last restart of the Gateway. This feature provides perspective on the 
 number of requests processed within the total server uptime.</p>

<p>The average load per minute tracks the number of work processes completed 
 in the Unix system over the past minute. This number should not exceed 
 4.0. If the number reaches 4.0, the Gateway is under heavy load and the 
 overall server performance will be slow.</p>
