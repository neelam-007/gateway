<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>FAQ Answers</h2>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer1></a>Why does my service 
 policy look different from the last time?</p>

<p>The Toggle view button in the Policy pane provides two different policy 
 views: policy and identities. &nbsp;When 
 the policy view is active, the button appears flat (unpressed) and all 
 policy assertions are visible. &nbsp;When 
 the identities view is active, the button appears sunken (pressed) and 
 the identity's assertions are visible. &nbsp;You 
 can toggle these views by clicking onto the Toggle view button.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer2></a>I do not like the 
 look and feel of the user interface, can I customize the appearance to 
 suit my needs?</p>

<p>The Preferences button launches a dialog box where the look and feel 
 of the user interface can be changed. Disconnect from the Manager, change 
 the Preferences, and then reconnect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer3></a>How do I view the 
 service policy details?</p>

<p>You can view the service policy details by right-clicking on the service 
 name. Select Service policy from the pop-up menu. The service policy details 
 will display in the Policy pane on the right-hand side of the user interface.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer4></a>Can I cancel out after 
 revoking a certificate?</p>

<p>No, you cannot cancel from a user certificate revoking action. &nbsp;This 
 action takes place immediately after you choose to revoke a user certificate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer5></a>Why does nothing happen 
 after I modify a service policy?</p>

<p>If you have multiple services defined, ensure that you are modifying 
 the correct service. The service's Bindings folder may help you to identify 
 the actual Web service. The name of the Service policy and the Service 
 URL (in the routing properties) may be misleading, especially if they 
 were incorrectly defined.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer6></a>Why did the identities 
 under the LDAP directory disappear?</p>

<p>The LDAP may have been re-configured by the administrator. &nbsp;Disconnect 
 from the Manager, then connect again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer7></a>When performing a 
 search on identity providers, what wild cards can I use?</p>

<p>The available search wild cards are: “?” for a single character, and 
 “*” for a substring.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer8></a>After revoking a user’s 
 certificate, the Gateway does not authorize the password. &nbsp;Why?</p>

<p>When revoking a user certificate, the user’s password will be reset. 
 The administrator must change the user's password after revoking the certificate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer9></a>Why can't I see the 
 logs and statistics tabs after I select the Gateway Log and Statistics 
 items in the View menu?</p>

<p>This may be a result of the sizing of your application window. Maximize 
 the application window to display the Logs and Statistics tabs in the 
 bottom of the user interface.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer10></a>Why does the inactivity 
 timeout not take effect?</p>

<p>The Inactivity Timeout option is not active when Gateway log and/or 
 Statistics are displayed and the auto-refresh option is selected. These 
 features stop background activities (such as the inactivity timeout) in 
 order to continuously refresh information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer11></a>Why does the user 
 certificate not revoke after I have changed the user password?</p>

<p>Ensure that the new password is different from the old password. &nbsp;The 
 certificate only revokes when the new password is different from the previous 
 password. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer12></a>Why doesn't the sliding 
 scale Manager Log work?</p>

<p>The sliding scale change is to control the future logs. The scale does 
 not filter the past logs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer13></a>I have deleted a 
 user identity from a service policy. &nbsp;Why 
 can the user still access the service?</p>

<p>Duplicate entries of the identity may exist in the service policy and 
 only one has been deleted. If a service policy has a long list of identities, 
 you may want to create a group in order to minimize security issues caused 
 by human error.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer14></a>I added a user/group 
 to a service policy, but the user could not be authenticated. &nbsp;Why?</p>

<p>Verify that the service policy has been validated and saved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer15></a>After entering the 
 correct credentials for a protected Web service (requiring Identity, Password, 
 and Realm), the Web service cannot be accessed. Why?</p>

<p>Verify that the service policy was saved after updating the policy with 
 the Web service authentication information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer16></a>What parameters should 
 I use when creating a new external identity provider such as LDAP or MS 
 Active Directory?</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">LDAP Identity Provider</p>

<p>Most LDAP providers can support anonymous binding and do not require 
 search credentials. As a result, you can omit values for the Bind DN and 
 Bind password.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Identity Provider: myLDAP<br>
Provider type: LDAP<br>
LDAP host url: &nbsp;ldap://ldapserver:389 
 <br>
search base: dc=layer7-tech, dc=com</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">MS Active Directory Identity Provider</p>

<p>Some LDAP providers such as MS Active Directory do not support anonymous 
 binding. The Manager needs to capture the search credentials. The search 
 credentials are usually the username/password for an account that has 
 search permission (not to be confused &nbsp;with 
 the LDAP admin account).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Identity Provider: myMSAD<br>
Provider type: MS Active Directory<br>
LDAP host url: ldap://mail.abc.com:3268<br>
search base: ou=ABC Company Users,dc=ABC,dc=LOCAL<br>
Bind DN: mybrowse<br>
Bind Password: mypassword</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer17></a>Why are my Agent 
 users receiving an “Error in Assertion Processing” message when the Manager 
 validates the policy as OK?</p>

<p>When validating a service policy, the routing and Web service location 
 are not checked or validated. Only the composition of the policy is validated. 
 Ensure that the Web service policy is sending requests to the correct 
 URL. If the routing URL is incorrect, amend the service policy by right-clicking 
 on the routing assertion, selecting Routing properties, and changing the 
 Service URL.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer18></a>I can see the user 
 identity in the service policy, but the user cannot authenticate. &nbsp;Why?</p>

<p>Check to see if the user has been removed from the identity provider 
 list. The user may have been removed from the identity provider after 
 being added to a service policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name=FAQAnswer19></a><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Why can't I 
 view the users in my identity provider?</B></span></p>

<p>When a user attempts to configure an identity provider with incorrect 
 information (incorrect URL, search base, or bind DN/password). &nbsp;The 
 Gateway is not able to access the identity provider to retrieve information 
 and returns the error below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer20></a>When do I use Web 
 service credentials? </p>

<p>Some Web services are anonymous, while other Web services are protected 
 with authentication. Web service credentials (identity, password, realm) 
 are required if the Web service to be consumed is protected with authentication. 
 The SecureSpan Manager administrator can configure a service policy to 
 use Web service credentials on the routing assertion. Right-click the 
 routing assertion and select Routing properties to enter the identity, 
 password, and realm. Be sure to save the policy for the changes to take 
 affect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer21></a>How do I set up a 
 Web service that is protected with authentication on Internet Information 
 Services (IIS)?</p>

<p>To set up a Web service on IIS:</p>

<ol style="list-style: decimal;"
	type=1>
	
	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Open up Internet Information Services (IIS) on 
 the web server.</p></li>
	
	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Select your web service, then go to <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Directory 
 Security</B></span> to turn off the anonymous credential requirement.</p></li>
	
	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Select <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Basic 
 authentication</B></span> to turn on credential requirement. Sample credentials 
 are - &nbsp;identity: 
 myName, password: myPassword, realm: myCompany. </p></li>
</ol>

<p class="notenumbered"><span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Note:</I></span> The 
 identity must be a valid user on the server. </p>

<ol start=4
	style="list-style: decimal;"
	type=1>
	
	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Apply the changes.</p></li>
	
	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Use the credentials (e.g. identity: myName, password: 
 myPassword, realm: myCompany) to consume the web service.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Error Message Answers</h2>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer1></a>There was an error 
 updating Group SSGAdmin</p>

<p>This is a valid error. The administrator is forbidden to remove all 
 members from the “SSGAdmin” group. One user must remain as an administrator 
 to be able to log in to the SecureSpan<symbol name=Trademark>&#8482; 
 Manager.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer2></a>Error saving service 
 and policy</p>

<p>If multiple Manager applications attempt to modify the same policy simultaneously, 
 conflicts can occur. The administrator should either disconnect the additional 
 Managers or refresh the view to incorporate other changes. Once done, 
 the administrator can try saving again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer3></a>Cannot connect to 
 the service https://&lt;hostname&gt;:8443. &nbsp;Please 
 check your connection settings and application log for details. &nbsp;If 
 problem persist, contact your network administrator.</p>

<p>Ensure that the URL you have entered for the Gateway in the Manager 
 is correct. If you are using a hostname (not an IP address) for the Gateway 
 URL, ensure that the hostname is reachable. To do this, ping the Gateway 
 using the hostname (&quot;ping [hostname]&quot;).</p>

<p>If the settings are correct and the administrator is unable to ping 
 the server, there may be another problem with resolving the hostname. 
 Enter the hostname information into the Manager server's hosts file. The 
 hosts file can be located at: </p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Windows systems: C:\[windows directory]\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</p></li>
	
	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Linux systems: &nbsp;/etc/hosts</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Ensure that the following entry appears in that file: IPAddress MyGateway 
 MyGateway.MyCompany.com.</p>

<p>&quot;IPAddress&quot; is the IP address of the server, &quot;MyGateway&quot; 
 is the local host name, and &quot;MyGateway.MyCompany.com&quot; is the 
 full server name. An example would be: 10.10.10.10 servername servername.company.com.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer4></a>Admin service not 
 available at host [gateway hostname]</p>

<p>Try to ping the Gateway hostname from the machine running the Manager. 
 If the ping does not receive a response, check to see if the Gateway's 
 IP address has been modified or if the Gateway resides behind a firewall.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer5></a>Access control specified 
 without authentication scheme (id assertion without prior cred assertion) 
 </p>

<p style="font-weight: normal;">This is an error that appears when validating 
 a policy. The identity assertion has been placed before the authentication 
 method. In order for the policy to be validated as okay, the authentication 
 method must be position before the identities. </p>

<p style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer6></a>Duplicate identity 
 (two id assertions in same path) </p>

<p style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This 
 is an error that appears when validating a policy. Two identical identities 
 have been used in the same assertion folder. Delete one of the duplicate 
 identities.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer7></a>A credential assertion

<p>This error message appears when you attempt to log on to the SecureSpan 
 Gateway with an incompatible version of the SecureSpan Manager. The Manager 
 and the Gateway must be the same version number for the log on to be successful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer13></a>System.NullReferenceException:

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer14></a>Error 500 Internal 
 Server Error</p>

<p>When all SOAP requests return this HTTP error message, check the Gateway 
 port numbers defined for the Web service port and the SSL port. &nbsp;By 
 default, the SecureSpan Agent is configured to send outgoing requests 
 to the Gateway to standard ports - Web Service port 8080 and SSL port 
 8443. &nbsp;If 
 the Gateway is listening to non-standard port numbers, you can configure 
 the SecureSpan Agent to use these ports. </p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">To configure the Agent:</p>

<ol style="list-style: decimal;"
	type=1>
	
	<li class="kadov-p"><p>In the Agent GUI, select <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>File</B></span> 
 &gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Properties</B></span>. The Gateway Properties 
 dialog box appears.</p></li>
	
	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Network</B></span> 
 tab.</p></li>
	
	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Under Outgoing requests to the Gateway, select 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Gateway requires custom ports</B></span>.

<p>This error message appears when the published service's WSDL is inconsistent 
 with the service URL where the request is routing. Check with your SecureSpan 
 Gateway administrator.</p>

<p>In the Manager: Check whether the routing URL (right-click on the routing 
 assertion and select Routing properties) is compatible with the published 
 service policy WSDL (right-click on the service and select View Service 
 Wsdl).</p>

<p>If they are not compatible or you want the routing URL to use the original 
 one, reset the routing assertion service URL. To do this, right-click 
 onto the policy's routing assertion and select Routing properties from 
 the pop-up menu. Click on the Default button beside the Service URL, then 
 click OK. </p>
