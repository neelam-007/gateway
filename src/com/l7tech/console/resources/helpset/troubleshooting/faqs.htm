<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2>FAQ Answers</h2>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer1></a>Why does my service 

 policy look different from the last time?</p>



<p>The Toggle view button in the Policy pane provides two different policy 

 views: policy and identities. &nbsp;When 

 the policy view is active, the button appears flat (unpressed) and all 

 policy assertions are visible. &nbsp;When 

 the identities view is active, the button appears sunken (pressed) and 

 the identity's assertions are visible. &nbsp;You 

 can toggle these views by clicking onto the Toggle view button.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer2></a>I do not like the 

 look and feel of the user interface, can I customize the appearance to 

 suit my needs?</p>



<p>The Preferences button launches a dialog box where the look and feel 

 of the user interface can be changed. Disconnect from the Manager, change 

 the Preferences, and then reconnect.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer3></a>How do I view the 

 service policy details?</p>



<p>You can view the service policy details by right-clicking on the service 

 name. Select Service policy from the pop-up menu. The service policy details 

 will display in the Policy pane on the right-hand side of the user interface.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer4></a>Can I cancel out after 

 revoking a certificate?</p>



<p>No, you cannot cancel from a user certificate revoking action. &nbsp;This 

 action takes place immediately after you choose to revoke a user certificate.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer5></a>Why does nothing happen 

 after I modify a service policy?</p>



<p>If you have multiple services defined, ensure that you are modifying 

 the correct service. The service's Bindings folder may help you to identify 

 the actual Web Service. The name of the Service policy and the Service

 URL (in the routing properties) may be misleading, especially if they 

 were incorrectly defined.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer6></a>Why did the identities 

 under the LDAP directory disappear?</p>



<p>The LDAP may have been re-configured by the administrator. &nbsp;Disconnect 

 from the Manager, then connect again.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer7></a>When performing a 

 search on identity providers, what wild cards can I use?</p>



<p>The available search wild cards are: “?” for a single character, and 

 “*” for a substring.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer8></a>After revoking a user’s 

 certificate, the Gateway does not authorize the password. &nbsp;Why?</p>



<p>When revoking a user certificate, the user’s password will be reset. 

 The administrator must change the user's password after revoking the certificate.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer9></a>Why can't I see the 

 logs and statistics tabs after I select the Gateway Log and Statistics 

 items in the View menu?</p>



<p>This may be a result of the sizing of your application window. Maximize 

 the application window to display the Logs and Statistics tabs in the 

 bottom of the user interface.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer10></a>Why does the inactivity 

 timeout not take effect?</p>



<p>The Inactivity Timeout option is not active when Gateway log and/or 

 Statistics are displayed and the auto-refresh option is selected. These 

 features stop background activities (such as the inactivity timeout) in 

 order to continuously refresh information.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer11></a>Why does the user 

 certificate not revoke after I have changed the user password?</p>



<p>Ensure that the new password is different from the old password. &nbsp;The 

 certificate only revokes when the new password is different from the previous 

 password. </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer12></a>Why doesn't the sliding 

 scale Manager Log work?</p>



<p>The sliding scale change is to control the future logs. The scale does 

 not filter the past logs.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer13></a>I have deleted a 

 user identity from a service policy. &nbsp;Why 

 can the user still access the service?</p>



<p>Duplicate entries of the identity may exist in the service policy and 

 only one has been deleted. If a service policy has a long list of identities, 

 you may want to create a group in order to minimize security issues caused 

 by human error.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer14></a>I added a user/group 

 to a service policy, but the user could not be authenticated. &nbsp;Why?</p>



<p>Verify that the service policy has been validated and saved.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer15></a>After entering the 

 correct credentials for a protected Web Service (requiring Identity, Password,

 and Realm), the Web Service cannot be accessed. Why?</p>



<p>Verify that the service policy was saved after updating the policy with 

 the Web Service authentication information.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer16></a>What parameters should 

 I use when creating a new external identity provider such as LDAP or MS 

 Active Directory?</p>



<p style="font-style: italic;">LDAP Identity Provider</p>



<p>Most LDAP providers can support anonymous binding and do not require 

 search credentials. As a result, you can omit values for the Bind DN and 

 Bind password.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<p>Identity Provider: myLDAP<br>

Provider type: LDAP<br>

LDAP host url: &nbsp;ldap://ldapserver:389 

 <br>

search base: dc=layer7-tech, dc=com</p>



<p style="font-style: italic;">MS Active Directory Identity Provider</p>



<p>Some LDAP providers such as MS Active Directory do not support anonymous 

 binding. The Manager needs to capture the search credentials. The search 

 credentials are usually the username/password for an account that has 

 search permission (not to be confused &nbsp;with 

 the LDAP admin account).</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<p>Identity Provider: myMSAD<br>

Provider type: MS Active Directory<br>

LDAP host url: ldap://mail.abc.com:3268<br>

search base: ou=ABC Company Users,dc=ABC,dc=LOCAL<br>

Bind DN: mybrowse<br>

Bind Password: mypassword</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer17></a>Why are my Agent 

 users receiving an “Error in Assertion Processing” message when the Manager 

 validates the policy as OK?</p>



<p>When validating a service policy, the routing and Web Service location

 are not checked or validated. Only the composition of the policy is validated. 

 Ensure that the Web Service policy is sending requests to the correct

 URL. If the routing URL is incorrect, amend the service policy by right-clicking 

 on the routing assertion, selecting Routing properties, and changing the 

 Service URL.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer18></a>I can see the user 

 identity in the service policy, but the user cannot authenticate. &nbsp;Why?</p>



<p>Check to see if the user has been removed from the identity provider 

 list. The user may have been removed from the identity provider after 

 being added to a service policy.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><a name=FAQAnswer19></a><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Why can't I 

 view the users in my identity provider?</B></span></p>



<p>When a user attempts to configure an identity provider with incorrect 

 information (incorrect URL, search base, or bind DN/password). &nbsp;The 

 Gateway is not able to access the identity provider to retrieve information 

 and returns the error below.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer20></a>When do I use Web 

 service credentials? </p>



<p>Some Web services are anonymous, while other Web services are protected 

 with authentication. Web Service credentials (identity, password, realm)

 are required if the Web Service to be consumed is protected with authentication.

 The SecureSpan Manager administrator can configure a service policy to 

 use Web Service credentials on the routing assertion. Right-click the

 routing assertion and select Routing properties to enter the identity, 

 password, and realm. Be sure to save the policy for the changes to take 

 affect.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer21></a>How do I set up a 

 Web Service that is protected with authentication on Internet Information

 Services (IIS)?</p>



<p>To set up a Web Service on IIS:</p>



<ol style="list-style: decimal;"

	type=1>

	

	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Open up Internet Information Services (IIS) on 

 the web server.</p></li>

	

	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Select your Web Service, then go to <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Directory

 Security</B></span> to turn off the anonymous credential requirement.</p></li>

	

	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Select <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Basic 

 authentication</B></span> to turn on credential requirement. Sample credentials 

 are - &nbsp;identity: 

 myName, password: myPassword, realm: myCompany. </p></li>

</ol>



<p class="notenumbered"><span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Note:</I></span> The 

 identity must be a valid user on the server. </p>



<ol start=4

	style="list-style: decimal;"

	type=1>

	

	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Apply the changes.</p></li>

	

	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Use the credentials (e.g. identity: myName, password: 

 myPassword, realm: myCompany) to consume the Web Service.</p></li>

</ol>

<h2>Error Message Answers</h2>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer1></a>There was an error 

 updating Group SSGAdmin</p>



<p>This is a valid error. The administrator is forbidden to remove all 

 members from the “SSGAdmin” group. One user must remain as an administrator 

 to be able to log in to the SecureSpan<symbol name=Trademark>&#8482; 

 Manager.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer2></a>Error saving service 

 and policy</p>



<p>If multiple Manager applications attempt to modify the same policy simultaneously, 

 conflicts can occur. The administrator should either disconnect the additional 

 Managers or refresh the view to incorporate other changes. Once done, 

 the administrator can try saving again.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer3></a>Cannot connect to 

 the service https://&lt;hostname&gt;:8443. &nbsp;Please 

 check your connection settings and application log for details. &nbsp;If 

 problem persist, contact your network administrator.</p>



<p>Ensure that the URL you have entered for the Gateway in the Manager 

 is correct. If you are using a hostname (not an IP address) for the Gateway 

 URL, ensure that the hostname is reachable. To do this, ping the Gateway 

 using the hostname (&quot;ping [hostname]&quot;).</p>



<p>If the settings are correct and the administrator is unable to ping 

 the server, there may be another problem with resolving the hostname. 

 Enter the hostname information into the Manager server's hosts file. The 

 hosts file can be located at: </p>



<ul style="list-style: disc;"

	type=disc>

	

	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Windows systems: C:\[windows directory]\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</p></li>

	

	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Linux systems: &nbsp;/etc/hosts</p></li>

</ul>



<p>Ensure that the following entry appears in that file: IPAddress MyGateway 

 MyGateway.MyCompany.com.</p>



<p>&quot;IPAddress&quot; is the IP address of the server, &quot;MyGateway&quot; 

 is the local host name, and &quot;MyGateway.MyCompany.com&quot; is the 

 full server name. An example would be: 10.10.10.10 servername servername.company.com.</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer4></a>Admin service not 

 available at host [gateway hostname]</p>



<p>Try to ping the Gateway hostname from the machine running the Manager. 

 If the ping does not receive a response, check to see if the Gateway's 

 IP address has been modified or if the Gateway resides behind a firewall.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer5></a>Access control specified 

 without authentication scheme (id assertion without prior cred assertion) 

 </p>



<p style="font-weight: normal;">This is an error that appears when validating 

 a policy. The identity assertion has been placed before the authentication 

 method. In order for the policy to be validated as okay, the authentication 

 method must be position before the identities. </p>



<p style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer6></a>Duplicate identity 

 (two id assertions in same path) </p>



<p style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This 

 is an error that appears when validating a policy. Two identical identities 

 have been used in the same assertion folder. Delete one of the duplicate 

 identities.</span></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer7></a>A credential assertion 

 requires client certs. Only internal identities support client certs. 

 </p>



<p style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This 

 is an error that appears when validating a policy. The credential assertion 

 being used requires the HTTP client certificate authentication method. 

 When using client certificates, only identities from the internal identity 

 provider can be used. </span></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer8></a>A credential assertion 

 requires digest authentication. Only internal identities support digest 

 authentication. </p>



<p style="font-weight: normal;">This is an error that appears when validating 

 a policy. The credential assertion being used requires the HTTP Digest 

 authentication method. When using client certificates, only identities 

 from the internal identity provider can be used. </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer9></a>XML Response Security

<p>This error message appears when you attempt to log on to the SecureSpan 

 Gateway with an incompatible version of the SecureSpan Manager. The Manager 

 and the Gateway must be the same version number for the log on to be successful.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer13></a>System.NullReferenceException:

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer14></a>Error 500 Internal 

 Server Error</p>



<p>When all SOAP requests return this HTTP error message, check the Gateway 

 port numbers defined for the Web Service port and the SSL port. &nbsp;By

 default, the SecureSpan Agent is configured to send outgoing requests 

 to the Gateway to standard ports - Web Service port 8080 and SSL port 

 8443. &nbsp;If 

 the Gateway is listening to non-standard port numbers, you can configure 

 the SecureSpan Agent to use these ports. </p>



<p style="font-style: italic;">To configure the Agent:</p>



<ol style="list-style: decimal;"

	type=1>

	

	<li class="kadov-p"><p>In the Agent GUI, select <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>File</B></span> 

 &gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Properties</B></span>. The Gateway Properties 

 dialog box appears.</p></li>

	

	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Network</B></span> 

 tab.</p></li>

	

	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Under Outgoing requests to the Gateway, select 

 <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Gateway requires custom ports</B></span>. 

 Type the custom port numbers into the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Web

 fields. </p></li>

	

	<li class="kadov-p"><p>Click <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>OK</B></span>.</p></li>

</ol>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer15></a>Server did not

<p>This error message appears when the published service's WSDL is inconsistent 

 with the service URL where the request is routing. Check with your SecureSpan 

 Gateway administrator.</p>



<p>In the Manager: Check whether the routing URL (right-click on the routing 

 assertion and select Routing properties) is compatible with the published 

 service policy WSDL (right-click on the service and select View Service 

 Wsdl).</p>



<p>If they are not compatible or you want the routing URL to use the original 

 one, reset the routing assertion service URL. To do this, right-click 

 onto the policy's routing assertion and select Routing properties from 

 the pop-up menu. Click on the Default button beside the Service URL, then 

 click OK. </p>
