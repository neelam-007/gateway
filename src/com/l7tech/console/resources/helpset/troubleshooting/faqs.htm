<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>FAQ Answers</h2>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer1></a>Why does my service 
 policy look different from the last time?</p>

<p>The Toggle view button in the Policy pane provides two different policy 
 views: policy and identities. &nbsp;When 
 the policy view is active, the button appears flat (unpressed) and all 
 policy assertions are visible. &nbsp;When 
 the identities view is active, the button appears sunken (pressed) and 
 the identity's assertions are visible. &nbsp;You 
 can toggle these views by clicking onto the Toggle view button.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer2></a>I do not like the 
 look and feel of the user interface, can I customize the appearance to 
 suit my needs?</p>

<p>The Preferences button launches a dialog box where the look and feel 
 of the user interface can be changed. Disconnect from the Manager, change 
 the Preferences, and then reconnect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer3></a>How do I view the 
 service policy details?</p>

<p>You can view the service policy details by right-clicking on the service 
 name. Select Service policy from the pop-up menu. The service policy details 
 will display in the Policy pane on the right-hand side of the user interface.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer4></a>Can I cancel out after 
 revoking a certificate?</p>

<p>No, you cannot cancel from a user certificate revoking action. &nbsp;This 
 action takes place immediately after you choose to revoke a user certificate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer5></a>Why does nothing happen 
 after I modify a service policy?</p>

<p>If you have multiple services defined, ensure that you are modifying 
 the correct service. The service's Bindings folder may help you to identify 
 the actual Web service. The name of the Service policy and the Service 
 URL (in the routing properties) may be misleading, especially if they 
 were incorrectly defined.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer6></a>Why did the identities 
 under the LDAP directory disappear?</p>

<p>The LDAP may have been re-configured by the administrator. &nbsp;Disconnect 
 from the Manager, then connect again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer7></a>When performing a 
 search on identity providers, what wild cards can I use?</p>

<p>The available search wild cards are: “?” for a single character, and 
 “*” for a substring.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer8></a>After revoking a user’s 
 certificate, the Gateway does not authorize the password. &nbsp;Why?</p>

<p>When revoking a user certificate, the user’s password will be reset. 
 The administrator must change the user's password after revoking the certificate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer9></a>Why can't I see the 
 logs and statistics tabs after I select the Gateway Log and Statistics 
 items in the View menu?</p>

<p>This may be a result of the sizing of your application window. Maximize 
 the application window to display the Logs and Statistics tabs in the 
 bottom of the user interface.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer10></a>Why does the inactivity 
 timeout not take effect?</p>

<p>The Inactivity Timeout option is not active when Gateway log and/or 
 Statistics are displayed and the auto-refresh option is selected. These 
 features stop background activities (such as the inactivity timeout) in 
 order to continuously refresh information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer11></a>Why does the user 
 certificate not revoke after I have changed the user password?</p>

<p>Ensure that the new password is different from the old password. &nbsp;The 
 certificate only revokes when the new password is different from the previous 
 password. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer12></a>Why doesn't the sliding 
 scale Manager Log work. &nbsp;Why?</p>

<p>The sliding scale change is to control the future logs. The scale does 
 not filter the past logs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer13></a>I have deleted a 
 user identity from a service policy. &nbsp;Why 
 can the user still access the service?</p>

<p>Duplicate entries of the identity may exist in the service policy and 
 only one has been deleted. If a service policy has a long list of identities, 
 you may want to create a group in order to minimize security issues caused 
 by human error.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer14></a>I added a user/group 
 to a service policy, but the user could not be authenticated. &nbsp;Why?</p>

<p>Verify that the service policy has been validated and saved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer15></a>After entering the 
 correct credentials for a protected Web service (requiring Identity, Password, 
 and Realm), the Web service cannot be accessed. Why?</p>

<p>Verify that the service policy was saved after updating the policy with 
 the Web service authentication information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=FAQAnswer16></a>What parameters should 
 the I use when creating a new external identity provider such as LDAP 
 or MS Active Directory?</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">LDAP Identity Provider</p>

<p>Most LDAP providers can support anonymous binding and do not require 
 search credentials. As a result, you can omit values for the Bind DN and 
 Bind password.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Identity Provider: myLDAP<br>
Provider type: LDAP<br>
LDAP host url: &nbsp;ldap://ldapserver:389 
 <br>
search base: dc=layer7-tech, dc=com</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">MS Active Directory Identity Provider</p>

<p>Some LDAP providers such as MS Active Directory do not support anonymous 
 binding. The Manager needs to capture the search credentials. The search 
 credentials are usually the username/password for an account that has 
 search permission (not to be confused &nbsp;with 
 the LDAP admin account).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Identity Provider: myMSAD<br>
Provider type: MS Active Directory<br>
LDAP host url: ldap://mail.l7tech.com:3268<br>
search base: ou=Layer 7 Users,dc=L7TECH,dc=LOCAL<br>
Bind DN: browse<br>
Bind Password: password</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Error Message Answers</h2>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer1></a>There was an error 
 updating Group SSGAdmin</p>

<p>This is a valid error. &nbsp;The 
 administrator is forbidden to remove all members from the “SSGAdmin” group. 
 One user must remain as an administrator to be able to log in to the SecureSpan<symbol 
 name=Trademark>&#8482; Manager.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer2></a>Error saving service 
 and policy</p>

<p>If multiple Manager applications attempt to modify the same policy simultaneously, 
 conflicts occur. &nbsp;Close 
 the error message, refresh the service policy information, then continue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer3></a>Cannot connect to 
 the service https://&lt;hostname&gt;:8443. &nbsp;Please 
 check your connection settings and application log for details. &nbsp;If 
 problem persist, contact your network administrator.</p>

<p>Ensure that the IP address and the host name lookup table contains an 
 entry (IP hostname hostname.domain) of the Gateway server you are connecting 
 to. &nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, if the operating system running the Manager is UNIX, the 
 Gateway IP address is “192.169.12.123”, the hostname is “mygateway”, the 
 domain is “mycompany.com”. The “/etc/hosts” file should contain an entry 
 like: 192.169.12.123 mygateway mygateway.mycompany.com.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name=ErrorAnswer4></a>Admin service not 
 available at host &lt;gateway hostname&gt;</p>

<p>Try to ping the Gateway hostname from the machine running the Manager. 
 If the ping does not receive a response, check to see if the Gateway's 
 IP address has been modified or if the Gateway resides behind a firewall.</p>
