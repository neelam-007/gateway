<h1>Web Services Overview</h1>

<p>The primary function of the SecureSpan solution is to establish the 
 security layer on top of already existing Web services. Most of the Manager's 
 functionality is, therefore, focused on building and enabling security 
 policies. The key tasks in building Web services security are publishing 
 a service, building a security policy, and enabling the policy. </p>

<h2>Publishing Services</h2>

<p>Once administrators have set up the Manager (see the <a href="../setup/overview.htm">Setup 
 Overview</a>), they can proceed to publish protected Web services. All 
 new services are published via the Publish Services wizard. Once published 
 in the Manager, administrators can build customized security policies 
 that include authentication credentials and message routing data. See 
 the <a href="publishing_services.htm">Publishing Services</a> and <a href="creating_policies.htm">Creating 
 Policies</a> topics for more detailed information. </p>

<h2>Creating Services</h2>

<p>The Manager provides an additional layer of functionality for advanced 
 users. Architects and experienced Web services developers can use the 
 Create Service wizard to create their own Web Services Description Language 
 (WSDL). A WSDL is an XML-based language used to describe the services 
 a business offers and to provide a way for individuals and other businesses 
 to access those services electronically. See the <a href="creating_services.htm">Creating 
 Services</a> topic for more detailed information.</p>
