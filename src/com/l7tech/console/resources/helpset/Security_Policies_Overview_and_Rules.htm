<p>In the SecureSpan™ Manager, a security policy includes assertions that 
 determine the essential authentication method, identity credentials, transport 
 method, and routing method for the Web service. The specific types of 
 assertions, their relative location, and the other assertions determine 
 the properties and validity of a Web service security policy.</p>

<p>The assertions in the [Assertions] tab are organized into categories 
 corresponding to the main requirements of a Web services security policy:

<p style="margin-bottom: 9pt;">A security policy is constructed by moving 
 assertions from the [Assertions] tab into a meaningful and ordered tree 
 structure in the Policy Development window. </p>

<h4>A Policy Assertion Tree in the Policy Development Window:</h4>

<p><img src="LevelSS.gif" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" style="border: none;
				width: 548px;
				height: 268px;
				margin-left: 0px;
				margin-right: 0px;
				margin-top: 4px;
				margin-bottom: 10px;
				float: none;
				border-style: none;
				border-style: none;" width="548" height="268" border="0"></p>

<p style="margin-top: 9pt;">During processing, the SecureSpan™ Gateway 
 scans the policy assertions one-by-one and from top to bottom. Each processed 
 assertion has an outcome: It either succeeds or fails. When assertions 
 are grouped into an &quot;At least one assertion must evaluate to true&quot; 
 folder in the Policy Development window, each successive child assertion 
 is processed until a single assertion succeeds, yielding a success outcome 
 for the folder. If all child assertions in an &quot;At least one assertion 
 must evaluate to true&quot; folder fail, then the overall folder fails. 
 Similarly, when assertions are grouped into an &quot;All assertions must 
 evaluate to true&quot; folder, each successive child assertion is processed 
 until all assertions succeed, yielding a success outcome for the folder. 
 Processing in the &quot;All assertions must evaluate to true&quot; folder 
 will stop when the first child assertion fails, yielding a fail outcome 
 for the folder. Each security policy contains an implicit &quot;all must 
 be true&quot; assertion that requires that all first-level (non-child) 
 assertions (including first-level folders) succeed in order for the overall 
 security policy to succeed. If all first-level assertions succeed, then 
 the Web service requestor will receive a response message. If a first-level 
 assertion fails, then the Web service requestor will receive an error 
 message.</p>

 Organization and Dependency Rules</a></h2>

<div style="padding: 5px;
			background-color: #f8fbdd;

			margin-left: 4px;">
<p class="tipsnotes"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>NOTE:</B></span> If an 
 organization or dependency conflict occurs in the Policy Development window, 
 the SecureSpan™ Manager will display a notification message in the Policy 
 Validation Messages window. To enable the window, select [View] &gt; Policy 
 Messages from the Main Menu (check box checked). For more information, 
 see <a href="Configure_Edit_Security_Policies.htm">Configure and Edit 
 Security Policies</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Some security policy assertions work together and require the presence 
 of each other to succeed. The Grant Access to Users and Groups assertion 
 &quot;Identity is Joe,&quot; for example, requires the presence of an 
 authentication assertion, such as HTTP Basic, to provide the credentials 
 for validating Joe's identity. This arrangement will fail unless the authentication 
 assertion appears before the identity that it is providing credentials 
 for. In a security policy, therefore, both the presence and relative locations 
 of dependent assertions determines their individual success and the overall 
 validity of the policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All assertions — except for Sign/Encrypt Response, XSL Transformation, 
 and Validate XML Schema — must be placed before the message routing assertion. 
 Since assertions in the policy tree are processed from top to bottom, 
 the location of the routing assertion at the end of the policy ensures 
 that the other assertion requirements are met before the request is routed 
 to the protected Web service. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since each security policy contains an inherent &quot;All&quot; assertion 
 for first-level assertions and folders, and since an authentication assertion 
 (such as HTTP Basic) can only provide credentials for a single identity, 
 there should not be more than one first-level Grant Access to Users and 
 Groups assertion in a policy or within an &quot;All assertions must evaluate 
 to true&quot; folder. To grant access to more than one identity, place 
 the individual Grant Access to Users and Groups assertions in an &quot;At 
 least one assertion must evaluate to true&quot; folder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additional organization, configuration, and dependency information is 
 provided by the Policy Validation Messages window during the security 
 policy construction process. See <a href="Configure_Edit_Security_Policies.htm">Configure 
 and Edit Security Policies</a> for more information.</p>
