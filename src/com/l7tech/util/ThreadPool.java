/**
 * A ThreadPool contains a collection of re-usable threads. Since
 * there is a performance overhead in creating new threads, ThreadPool
 * can improve performance in threaded applications.
 * Pooled threads operate on Runnable targets and return back to the
 * pool when the Runnable.run method exits.
 *
 * The pool operates in two distinct modes:
 * timeout mode - is when positive timeout and idletimoeut values in ms
 * have been given. Pool uses timeout value as a wait timeout for an
 * available thread when maximum number of threads has been reached.
 * The idletimoeut value is used by individual threads when checking
 * if there has been a new Runnable assigned (after the initial Runnable
 * has run that created the Thread). If no Runnable has been assigned
 * during the idletimout period the thread exits and removes itself
 * from the pool.
 *
 * no timeout (blocking mode) - is when negative timeout values in ms
 * have been given. Pool waits indefinitely for an available thread when
 * maximum number of pooled threads has been reached.
 *
 * Additionally pool supports <CODE>ThreadPoolListener</CODE> registrations
 * that receives pool events. The listener methods are invoked on the
 * thread that generated the event.
