# "layer7-api module" version is decoupled from the Gateway version.
# This module produces the layer7-api-<major.minor.subminor>.jar file. This module/jar is also known as the Custom Assertion API.
# If updated, this jar file must be keep in sync in the following SVN repositories:
#   - CustomAssertions: lib/com.l7tech/
#   - CustomAssertionSample: lib/com.l7tech/
# Recommended guidelines for when to increment layer7-api version:
#   - Major: major changes to the published API (significant features added).
#   - Minor: minor changes to the published API from added feature(s).
#   - Subminor: minor changes to the published API from bug fix(es).
