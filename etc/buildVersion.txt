# Purpose: 
#  mapping build number to version number
#  used by rpm (ssg.spec) during upgrade to look up installed SSG version at %pre stage of ssg.spec
#  base on <buildNumber> extracted from filename "/ssg/dist/ROOT-b<buildNumber>.war" to look up its versionNumber accordingly
#
# Format: 
#  (<one or many buildNumber(s)>-to-<one versionNumber> reference)
#    buildNumber=versionNumber
#    buildNumber1,buildNumber2,buildNumberN=versionNumber
#  A versionNumber may have multiple buildNumbers
#  Of course, a buildNumber cannot belong to multiple versionNumbers

# buildNumber=versionNumber
3079=3.0
3087=3.0.1
3100,3102=3.0.2
