# This is the configuration file for radius_ldap_setup.sh script used to configure the SSG appliance
# to be able to authenticate its users (OS level only) using Radius, LDAP or Radius+LDAP.

# This file must comply with these requirements:
# - type: text (ASCII text)
# - name: radius_ldap_setup.conf
# - ownership: root
# - permissions: 600

# The above mentioned script must be called with this file full patha and name as the only argument:
# Example: .../radius_ldap_setup.sh /opt/SecureSpan/Appliance/config/radius_ldap_setup.conf

# CFG_TYPE variable can have only one of these values: "file", "ldap_only", "radius_only" or "radius_and_ldap"
# the "file" option is actually going to disable all the other possible authentication methods and provide
# only the local, default authentication using files
CFG_TYPE="file"

# LDAP_SRV_IP variable should contain the IP address of the LDAP server to be used.
# It's value should only be a host IP address, e.g. "10.7.48.130" (a CIDR notation may not work)
# This variable is only relevant if the CFG_TYPE variable is "ldap_only or "radius_and_ldap"
LDAP_SRV_IP="10.7.48.130"

# RADIUS_SRV_IP variable should contain the IP address of the Radius server to be used.
# It's value should only be a host IP address, e.g. "10.7.48.130" (a CIDR notation may not work)
# It is only relevant if the CFG_TYPE variable is "radius_only or "radius_and_ldap"
RADIUS_SRV_IP="10.7.48.130"

# LDAP_BASE variable should contain the DN used to ????, e.g. "dc=example,dc=com"
# It is only relevant if the CFG_TYPE variable is "ldap_only or "radius_and_ldap"
LDAP_BASE="dc=example,dc=com"

# RADIUS_SECRET variable should be the string used as shared secret by the Radius server, e.g. "poiu0987"
# It is only relevant if the CFG_TYPE variable is "radius_only or "radius_and_ldap"
RADIUS_SECRET="poiu0987"

# RADIUS_TIMEOUT should contain only one numeric value representing the time interval in seconds
# that the client should wait for the Radius server to reply, e.g. "3" for 3 seconds
# It is only relevant if the CFG_TYPE variable is "radius_only or "radius_and_ldap"
RADIUS_TIMEOUT="3"
