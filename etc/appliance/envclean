# Utility include for scripts invoked by sudo.
#
# This include assumes that the env_reset option was set and that sudo has already removed
# all but a tiny list of the user-provided environment variables.
#
# This include does NOT assume that the PATH has already been made secure, since we need
# to run with versions of sudo that do not yet support the secure_path option.
#

# Ensure PATH is sane, reasonably minimal, and includes no directories under the user's control
PATH="/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/bin"
export PATH

# Ensure JAVA_HOME is set
JAVA_HOME="/opt/SecureSpan/JDK"
export JAVA_HOME

# Ensure JAVA_OPTS is set
JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.ext.dirs=${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/ext"
export JAVA_OPTS
