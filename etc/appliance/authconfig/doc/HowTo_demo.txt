This is the final form of the information that I put together for a demo about Radius+LDAP integration of the SSG.

The 2 VMs that I used to set this up have all scripts and all other settings already in place.
 
This setup will make use of the LDAP server already in place on an SDE; the schema however was changed to accommodate posix accounts.

Our clients interested in this feature will need the followings:
- Objects in the LDAP server defined with these minimum details:
????
????
????
- A search filter for LDAP queries defined in Radius server’s configuration capable of returning the appropriate response regarding
the group membership of the user requesting access to SSG.
- All network communication necessary for SSG to communicate with LDAP and Radius servers


SERVER (SDE)

Setup de SDE in order to act as an LDAP server and RADIUS server:

Step 1: install the necessary packages:
- make yum available
- install freeRadius server version 1 or 2 as preferred as both work in the same way:

yum install freeradius2.x86_64 (or freeradius.x86_64)

(both versions have been tested with the same pam_radius module on the client and work in the same way)

These packages are already installed on the latest version of SDE (L7_demo_environment-v2.2.2c) so they don’t need to be installed:
openldap.x86_64, nss_ldap.x86_64, openldap-servers.x86_64, openldap-clients.x86_64

LDAP database needs to be modified to accommodate entries for posix accounts/groups.
In order to achieve that take the following steps:
- stop ldap server:
/etc/init.d/ldap stop

- remove the current database loaded while the SSG was transformed in an SDE:
rm –rf /var/lib/ldap/*

- start ldap server:
/etc/init.d/ldap start

- load the new database containing the necessary entries to test the authentication via radius with users located in LDAP only:
ldapadd -x -D "cn=manager,dc=l7tech,dc=com" -w 7layer –f layer7-demo-posix.ldif


Step 2: edit the configuration section of the script that will configure LDAP server and Radius server:
cd /root/
vim radius_ldap_srv_setup.sh

LDAP_SRV="localhost"
LDAP_BASE_DN="dc=l7tech,dc=com"
LDAP_ROOT_DN="cn=Manager,$LDAP_BASE_DN"

# the below hashed password is: “7layer” (without the double quotes)
LDAP_ROOT_PW=" {SSHA}NnxI+WpJrEwctK3ZtvDthhd4kei91wM6”
# to get the value for the above parameter use this command:
slappasswd -u -h {SSHA} -s 7layer 

LDAP_DIRECTORY="/var/lib/ldap"
CLIENT_IP="10.7.48.51"
CLIENT_SECRET="testing123"

Step 3: run the script:
./radius_ldap_srv_setup.sh

- there should be no errors.

===============================================================================

CLIENT (SSG 6.1)

Setup an SSG 6.1 in order to act as a client for centralized authentication via RADIUS + LDAP service provided by the above setup of the SDE.

Step 1: Make sure the following packages are installed:
openldap.x86_64
openldap-clients.x86_64
nss_ldap.x86_64
freeradius2.x86_64 (or freeradius.x86_64)
freeradius2-utils.x86_64
pam_radius-1.3.17-2.el5 (this is not available in the official RHEL repository!)

rpm -qa --qf '%{NAME}-%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}.%{ARCH}\n' openldap* nss_ldap freeradius nss_ldap

Step 2: Edit the configuration file for the script that will configure the client:
vi /opt/SecureSpan/Appliance/config/configfiles/radius_ldap_setup.conf

- relevant parameters in this case are:
CFG_TYPE="radius_and_ldap"
RADIUS_SRV_IP="10.7.48.50"
RADIUS_SECRET="testing123"
LDAP_TYPE="ldap"
LDAP_SRV="10.7.48.50"
LDAP_BASE="dc=l7tech,dc=com"
LDAP_PORT="389"
LDAP_ANONYM="yes"

Step 3: run the script with the configuration file as parameter, as follows (this will be accomplished via the interactive menu):
/opt/SecureSpan/Appliance/config/authconfig/radius_ldap_setup.sh -–configfile /opt/SecureSpan/Appliance/config/configfiles/radius_ldap_setup.conf

Step 4: create home directories for the users from LDAP:
mkdir /home/testuser{1,2,3}
cp –a /home/ssgconfig/.bash* /home/testuser1
cp –a /home/ssgconfig/.bash* /home/testuser2
cp –a /home/ssgconfig/.bash* /home/testuser3
groupadd –g 4000 ssgusers
chmod 700 /home/testuser1 /home/testuser2 /home/testuser3

At this point we will change the ownership of each of these directories; if the chown command will not complain it means that this system (the SSG)
was capable to communicate with the LDAP in order to retrieve information about the user invoked and so it was able to set the new owner for each folder:
chown –R testuser1:ssgusers /home/testuser1
chown –R testuser2:ssgusers /home/testuser2
chown –R testuser3:ssgusers /home/testuser3

This can be considered the first test.
Note: GID 4000 was chosen to make sure there are plenty of GID values to be used for local groups on the SSG system so that the chance of overlapping
will be minimum.

We now have 3 users for which the SSG Configuration Menu will be presented automatically at successful login.
At this point however, the menu will not be actually functional as we have not yet setup the access level for these users.
We can see in LDAP that they all belong to ssgusers group.

Step 5: configure sudoers to control the access level of the users that are members of ssgusers group:
On the SSG system:
cd /root
./modify_sudoers.sh

What the above script does is allowing the same level of access that ssgconfig user has to all users that are in the ssgusers group.

Step 6: remote real-time logging of all users’ commands (all command line activity) or via SSG Configuration Menu:
On the SSG system:
cd /dir/where/the/script/is/
./configure_rsyslog_for_remote_logging.sh SYSLOG_SRV_HOST SYSLOG_SRV_PORT

In our case will be:
./configure_rsyslog_for_remote_logging.sh 10.7.48.50 514

And then restart rsyslog to make it aware of the changes:
/etc/init.d/rsyslog restart

====================================================================

Testing the setup:

1. Commands on local system can use the user id / name that exists on LDAP but not on the system:
To see that there is no testuser1, 2 or 3 defined on the local system:
cat /etc/passwd | grep testuser
To see that we can use these users despite the fact they are not defined on the local system:
mkdir /tmp/testuser{1,2,3}
chown testuser1 /tmp/testuser1
chown testuser2 /tmp/testuser2
chown testuser3 /tmp/testuser3
- there should be no error – the chown command will make a call to the system for this user and the system will reply with the appropriate details
if the user is found on the LDAP server

ls –l /tmp
- there should be no complaints from the ls command; it will be able to display the content of the /tmp directory including the above mentioned
directories with complete ownership information

2. Auth via console:
At the console use the username and its password to login; whoami command can then be used to confirm the username of the user currently logged in.

3. Auth via SSH:
Using a ssh client, login using the correct credentials. Again, the whoami command can be used for confirmation.

4. During the login attempts we can watch the bash_commands.log file on the client (SSG) to see how bash is tracking the commands and actions of an user:
tail –f /var/log/bash_commands.log

5. Change the group membership of one of these users in order to see that it will not be granted access anymore to the SSG:
???

To add the "host" attribute to a user, he should have an objectClass that supports this. The "account" objectClass has the attribute, but is not
compatible with the "inetOrgPerson" objectClass.
Finally, take care that the hostname of the server is resolvable. pam_ldap will try to resolve the hostname, to find any aliasses (such as listed in /etc/hosts).
If the hostname is not resolvable, access is denied.
http://wiki.debian.org/LDAP/PAM

We can now see that tesuser1 and testuser2 still have access to the SSG and are also capable of utilizing the SSG Configuration Menu while testuser3
is not even allowed to login.

6. Observe how all commands ran from command line or via the menu are recorded in the /var/log/bash_commands.log file in real time and in the same time
are sent to the remote logserver (in our case the SDE configured configured to get log messages from remote hosts and store them in a directory structure
dynamically created based on remote host’s hostname:

On the SDE:
tail -f /var/log/syslog-ng/ssg-client/messages

Output similar to the following should be observed:
Aug 19 16:32:19 ssg-client/10.7.48.51 bash: user: testuser1 as testuser1 from ip: 10.7.48.51:pts/0 execs: 'ls –l /home'
Aug 19 16:32:19 ssg-client/10.7.48.51 bash: user: testuser1 as testuser1 from ip: 10.7.48.51:pts/0 execs: 'cat /etc/passwd'

====================================================

Notes - a few things that we should be aware of:
- As long as the filter used by Radius is capable of finding if the user has that required property (groupname) set in LDAP or not, access will be granted
or not for that user. A more granular access level can be configured via sudoers directly on the SSG system. At this point we do not support the configuration
of sudoers via the Configuration Menu.

- There is no need for an administrator to create home directories on the SSG system for the users defined in LDAP; PAM will create the home directories as
necessary at the first successful login for that user. These directories will not be removed at logout or at any other moment.

- There is no need for an administrator to create the group used to allow access to SSG (in our example above, the ssgusers group) on the SSG system; sudoers is
capable of using group information retrieved via from LDAP, for example, so even if the group is not created on the SSG system users pertaining to this group will
have the required access.

- It does not make sense to have a third type of users that will only be granted access but they are not capable of utilizing the SSG Configurartion Menu. However,
if this is necessary, there can be created users in LDAP with a different membership and then altered the filter used by Radius server so that it will also match
that groupname. Radius will grant access but sudoers will not let them run commands only available for higher access level – they will receive a shell but they will
be just normal restricted users. Basically, all these modifications are on the server side so it is more.

- Even if the SSG appliance (client) is setup to allow authentication via Radius for users defined in an LDAP directory, it will NOT ONLY communicates with the
Radius server. As there is no support in Name Service Switch (nsswitch) for radius, the SSG client will have to query the LDAP server directly. If we need to extend
NSS we may be able to do it by writing our own module for that (http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Extending-NSS.html#Extending-NSS).

- Securing the communication between Radius server and LDAP server or enabling other features related to this part was not in scope of this project.

- If the SSG appliance (client) is setup  to allow authentication for users defined in a Radius server only (without LDAP), the only encrypted part of the
communication with the server is the “secret” mentioned in plain text in configuration files on both the client and the server. All other details travelling through
the network are not encrypted – this is a limitation of the radius protocol. To overcome this one can use technologies like tunnelling or VPN.

=====================================================================

Troubleshooting:

- Daemons running:
ps axuf | grep ldap
ps axuf | grep radius

- Network communication details:
netstat –patunel | grep radius
netstat –patunel | grep slapd

tcpdump –nn –i ethX src CLIENT_IP and port 389
tcpdump –nn –i ethX src CLIENT_IP and port 1812
tcpdump –nn –i ethX src CLIENT_IP and port 1813

telnet LDAP_SRV 389

(radius is only listening on UDP so telnet is not useful)


- LDAP testing:
*** if there is no user to be searched for in LDAP directory:
ldapsearch -x -h LDAP_SRV -b 'dc=example,dc=com' '(objectclass=*)'

*** if a user was added to the LDAP directory:
ldapsearch -x -h LDAP_SRV -b 'uid=testuser3,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com' '(objectclass=*)'

*** Make LDAP server log to syslog and send the log messages to a file and watch the log file:

1. add this line to /etc/syslog.conf
local4.*                     /var/log/slapd.log

2. add this line to /etc/openldap/slapd.conf
loglevel 256

3.	/etc/init.d/syslog restart

4.	/etc/init.d/ldap restart

5.	tail –f /var/log/slapd.log


- Radius testing:

*** run radius server in foreground:
/usr/sbin/radiusd –X –A

*** test the Radius server:
radtest testuser3 "testuser3pass" localhost 2 testing123

-where:

testuser3	is the username
“testuser3pass”	is the password of the user testuser3
localhost	is the Radius server; can be replaced by an IP or name
2		is the value of the NAS-Port attribute; it does not matter what number is used here (between 0 and 2^31) but it has to exist
testing123	is the secret set in Radius server’s /etc/raddb/clients.conf file for this client

-Important: for the above command to work the client system should be able to find its own IP address (have an entry in the /etc/hosts file).
