# This is the configuration file for radius_ldap_setup.sh script used to configure the SSG appliance
# to be able to authenticate its users (OS level only) using Radius, LDAP or Radius+LDAP.

# This file must comply with these requirements:
# - type: text (ASCII text)
# - name: radius_ldap_setup.conf
# - ownership: ssgconfig
# - permissions: 600

# The above mentioned script must be called with this file full patha and name as the only argument:
# Example: .../radius_ldap_setup.sh /opt/SecureSpan/Appliance/config/radius_ldap_setup.conf

# The values of all of the variables below is case sensitive; must obey the case used in the description.


# CFG_TYPE variable can have only one of these values:
# - file (disables all the other authentication methods and provide only the local/file authentication)
# - ldap_only
# - radius_only
# - radius_with_ldap
# Default: file

# RADIUS_SRV_IP variable should contain the IP address of the Radius server to be used.
# It is relevant only if the CFG_TYPE variable is "radius_only or "radius_and_ldap".
# It's value should only be a host IP address, e.g. "10.7.48.130" (a CIDR notation may not work).
# Default: <empty>
RADIUS_SRV_HOST=""

# RADIUS_SECRET variable should be the string used as shared secret by the Radius server, e.g. "poiu0987"
# It is relevant only if the CFG_TYPE variable is "radius_only or "radius_and_ldap".
