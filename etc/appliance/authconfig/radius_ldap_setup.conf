# - type: text (ASCII text)
# - name: radius_ldap_setup.conf
# - ownership: ssgconfig

# It is relevant only if the CFG_TYPE variable is "radius_only or "radius_and_ldap".
# It's value should only be a host IP address, e.g. "10.7.48.130" (a CIDR notation may not work).
# Default: <empty>
RADIUS_SRV_HOST=""
